# Silvertec Api

Built on top of Django Rest Framework, this API is intended to provide funcionalities as mapped on [√ÅPI Doc](https://github.com/isaquealves/silvertec-api-doc).

# Development server

For development, I recommend using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) with some of its plugins, like virtualenv to keep things clearly separated.

Dependencies should be installed before running the commands specified below.

``` pip -r requirements.txt ```

After this, go to application root directory and run:

``` python manage.py runserver ```
